Question:
Solve the Equation
Given a sequence of n integers p(1), p(2),â€¦p(n), where each element is distinct and satisfies 1<=p(x)<=n. For each x where 1<=x<=n, find any integer y such that p(p(y))=x and print the value of y on a new line.

Function Description

Complete the Equation function in the editor below. It should return an array of integers that represent the values of y
The equation has the following parameter(s):

p: an array of integers
Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line contains n space-separated integers p[i] where 1<=i<=n.

Output Format

For each x from 1 to n, print an integer denoting any valid y satisfying the equation p(p(y)) on a new line.
